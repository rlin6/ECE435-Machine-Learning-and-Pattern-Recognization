The best performance among these methods will lower bound what we expect to achive using a Neural Network. Hence it will provide a benchmark for the next round of methods: Multinomial Softmax Regression, a one hidden layer neural network, a Multilayer feedforward neural network, and a convolutional neural network. \n","  \n","The SVM and logistic regression a naturally binary classifiers. But the methods can be used to perform multi-class classification using the one-versus-the-rest method. As the name suggests this trains $c$ binary classifiers, each of which distinguishes one class from the rest. The final classification is made by resolving conflicting classifications (no need to go into the details)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8PTCu4wYjbks","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669165732420,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":153,"user":{"displayName":"Ricky Lin","userId":"03252822320030106766"}},"outputId":"a79fbab9-8a25-403f-f489-4d9247c4b7f0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn* enabled (https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex)\n"]}],"source":["# ! python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n","# ! python -m pip install scikit-learn-intelex\n","\n","from sklearnex import patch_sklearn\n","patch_sklearn()\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import sklearn\n","from time import time\n","import datetime\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","# from google.colab import files\n","# uploaded = files.upload()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-lQZOv-ljbku"},"source":["## Kernel-SVM on MNIST"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HeDQjK7ejbkv"},"source":["**1.1)** First, import the provided subsets of the MNIST dataset:  \n","MNISTcwtrain1000.npy and  MNISTcwtest100.npy\n","\n","Normalize the scalar data values to the range [0,1].\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FGn_SLkVjbkw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669165734929,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":300,"user":{"displayName":"Ricky Lin","userId":"03252822320030106766"}},"outputId":"6ff7b284-dfa3-444f-e1fd-d3d3a30ef01a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["training data:  (784, 10000)\n","testing data:  (784, 1000)\n"]}],"source":["train_data = np.load('MNISTcwtrain1000.npy')\n","train_data = train_data.astype(dtype='float64')\n","test_data = np.load('MNISTcwtest100.npy')\n","test_data = test_data.astype(dtype='float64')\n","\n","train_data = train_data/255.0\n","test_data = test_data/255.0\n","print('training data: ', train_data.shape)\n","print('testing data: ', test_data.shape)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ff9qgkKvjbkx"},"source":["**1.2)** The SVM can be used to classify multiclass data.
